Our platform is designed to (i) identify properties for acquisition that offer attractive returns across CBRE-EA Tier 1 industrial real estate markets, industries, and tenants, (ii) provide growth through our ownership of high-quality assets, property management and pursuit of acquisitions in an attractive opportunity set, and (iii) capitalize our business appropriately given the characteristics of our assets. We are organized and conduct our operations to maintain our qualification as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u0093Code\u0094), and generally are not subject to federal income tax to the extent we currently distribute our income to our stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We remain subject to state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. As of December 31, 2024, we owned 591 buildings in 41 states with approximately 116.6 million rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2024, we had 11 development projects (which are not included in the building count noted above). As of December 31, 2024, our buildings were approximately 96.5% leased, with no single tenant accounting for more than approximately 2.9% of our total annualized base rental revenue and no single industry accounting for more than approximately 11.3% of our total annualized base rental revenue. We intend to maintain a diversified mix of tenants to limit our exposure to any single tenant or industry. As of December 31, 2024, our Operating Portfolio was approximately 97.3% leased. Straight-line Rent Change on new and renewal leases together grew approximately 41.8% and 44.0% during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and our Cash Rent Change on new and renewal leases together grew approximately 28.3% and 31.0% during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have fully integrated acquisition, leasing and operations platforms led by a senior management team with decades of industrial real estate experience. Our mission is to deliver attractive long-term stockholder returns in all market environments by growing cash flow through disciplined investment in high-quality real estate while maintaining a strong balance sheet."},"fullTimeEmployees":{"0":91},"companyOfficers":{"0":[{"maxAge":1,"name":"Mr. William R.
